# Adventure-of-code
This is a repository about the  25-days challenge called Adventure of Code. 
I take this challenge because I want to improve my programming logic skills and put into practice the knowledge I have gained in the python programming language. I know these codes are neither professional nor efficient, but  I have found a passion for programming and I have fun with these challenges. 
If someone finds these codes interesting and wants to give to me an opinion or suggestion feel free to write to me at ederperezgarcia@gmail.com 
I took these challenges from the web page https://adventofcode.com/
Thanks
